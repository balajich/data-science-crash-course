## Central Tendency
According to **Professor Bowley**, averages are “statistical constants which
enable us to comprehend in a single effort the significance of the whole”. They
throw light as to how the values are concentrated in the central part of the distribution.

For this reason they are also called the measures of central
tendency, an average is a single value which is considered as the most
representative for a given set of data
### Mean
Arithmetic mean (also called mean) is defined as the sum of all the
observations divided by the number of observations
