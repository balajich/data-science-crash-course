-------
Basic Life cycle of a Data Sciene Project

Data Prepartion phase -- 70 to 80 effort goes here
Statistics --
Central Tendency -- mean median mode
Skewness
Distribution
Startion , Variance , coeffient variance

Data Prepartion
-- Treating missing value --
-- Numerical , Catlogerical

Data Imputation -- Treating missing values
mean, median, mode, some random number .. .which apt?

######################

statis
-----
Central Tendency
Mean or Average

Single value ---which describes the entrie data

Maths -- 95 ... what is average mark in calls --- 98.5

Mean .. where data is centered

Problem .. it wont give you entire information
Mean .. is impacted with out liers

Startup .. they avege salary is  50,000
What is the range
10,000 to 90,0000
10,000+90000/2 -- 50,000
CEO- 90K
Eng -10 k

Range -- lower to uper bound

#####################

mean is also impacted by outlier
if a dapoint is +3d or -3std ...

Avge - 50K
CEO Salary -- 90K
10K
Distribution
Normal Distribution ---

Mean is not always apt .. when we have outliers
Median ----
Median is not impacted by outlier

Median is not impacted by outlier

Mode --- Most occurirng .. most frequest

1,2,3,4,4,4,5,6,7,150,150,150

Mode -150
There can be multiple modes in data set
1,2,1,2
Impacted by outliers and has multiple values

Mode is for categorical varible ---  Color -- red , green , yelllo

##################
if a values is greater than or less than 3 standard deviatios -- you can call it is as outlier
quartiles
percentiles
My data 55 marks in 10th 1970  -- 40  (mean)
I got 90 marks in 1996 ( 95) -- mean
